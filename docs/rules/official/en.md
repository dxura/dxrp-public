- **Hate Speech is not tolerated** (hate based on religion, sexuality, identity, race, etc.)

- Alt accounts are allowed only for legitimate secondary characters; using them to evade punishment or gain an advantage is prohibited and will lead to a **PERMANENT BAN**

  - If you cause trouble by repeatedly telling people you are reporting them, you will be punished

---

### 🔷 Building

- Houses require a minimum of 1 entrance. You can block off doors that you don't use
- Bases must always be accessible without the need to place props or entities
- Every part of a base must be reachable by a raider, even if nothing is in that area
- Builds should not take an unnecessary amount of public space. If you build in public areas, be reasonable
- If you can shoot at someone, they must be able to see you and shoot back at you
- You may not force players to crouch or jump at any point in your base, even to fight back
- Bases cannot be built in a way that will cause players to get stuck permanently in any part of it
- Bases may not have mazes built within to artificially extend the raid duration
- Bases may not purposefully impede player movement (such as placing props too close to each other to slow down players)
- Reaching a base's entrance should not rely on luck / a glitch / an exploit
- The entrance of a base must be reasonably easy to find
  - It should be big enough to be noticeable, and stand out in some way (color, different prop from surroundings, etc.)
- You cannot block off map features (weed drop off, trash cans, ATMs). They must always be clearly accessible
  - You must always be able to walk over the entire weed drop off. No props can be placed in a way that would affect player movement over it
- Only purchase doors to buildings and rooms you will actually use
- If your base can harm other players, make sure that it has reasonable counterplay that does not rely on luck
- All bases should be raidable with a crowbar; you cannot make players rely on finding a code

---

### 🔷 Fading Doors

- A maximum of 2 fading doors can be used as doors per base (this includes any door used to reach valuables or any part of the base)
  - You cannot hide valuables behind multiple fading doors, even if individually they would only require a raider to break 2 fading doors
- Fading doors used for other purposes do not count towards that limit. These fading doors cannot give an unfair advantage
  - Other purposes can be an emergency exit (a door that can only be used from one direction), peep holes (fading door that can be toggled to shoot through), etc.
  - If a door can be broken through from the outside, it is not an emergency exit, and counts as a normal door
- Always leave enough space between 2 doors (both fading and normal) to be able to comfortably stand
- Fading doors must be reasonably easy to see and distinguish from walls

## 🆘 What to Do When a Rule is Broken

### Option 1: Contact Staff In-Game

Players with the **"staff"** tag in-game are there to help you. They can warn, kick, and ban players.

### Option 2: Contact a Trusted Member

If no staff are available and the issue is major, players with the **"trusted"** tag can kick in severe situations. They will not kick for minor infractions like a few RDMs or RDAs.

### Option 3: Report on Discord

If no one is online to help you, join the Discord server and make a player report. Make sure to have video evidence if needed, and the offending player's ID.

---

## 📝 How to Make a Report

- Most reports will require proof, such as a clip. Always include enough context before and after the incident
- If on Discord, go to the **#player-reports** channel and create a ticket with the player's name and Steam ID
- **Lying on a report will get you punished**, and so will behaving disrespectfully
- For recording, software such as the Steam recording system or Medal is recommended
